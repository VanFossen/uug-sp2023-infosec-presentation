# UUG Information Security (Cryptography) Presentation

Since this presentation is not directly connected to Unix/Linux, I wanted to provide some context if a non-security focused student wants to jump in and try to give this presentation.

## The general topics I wanted to cover

- The CIA Triad

- Basic cryptography terminology/concepts

- Kerckhoffs's principle

- Types of Ciphers

  - ECB, CBC, OFB

- Types of Encryption

  - Symmetric encryption

    - One-Time Pad (OTP)

    - Feistel Cipher

    - Data Encryption Standard (DES)

    - Triple DES (3DES)

    - Advanced Encryption Standard

  - Asymmetric encryption

    - Diffie Hellman Key Exchange (DH)

    - Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)

    - Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC)

- Comparison of Symmetric and Asymmetric Algorithms

- Quantum Threats to Cryptography

## Breakdown of the topics

### The CIA Triad

Covers the general topics of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Discussed how the topics work in a way where its mostly pick two, but you cannot choose all three (typically).

### Basic cryptography terminology/concepts

Explained the basics around `plaintext`, `keys`, `ciphertext`, and `cleartext`.

### Kerckhoffs's principle

Explained how modern cryptographic algorithms focus on the security of the key. Most of the time, all other aspects of the algorithm are publicly available and open-source.

### Types of Ciphers

Explained the general difference between a block and stream cipher.

#### Block cipher mode of operations (ECB, CBC, OFB)

Looked at the different modes and their pros and cons (duplicate ciphertext with same plaintext block, parallelization, if data is lost can you still encrypt/decrypt properly?)

### Types of Encryption

Looked at the general difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

#### Symmetric encryption

##### One-Time Pad (OTP)

Looked at how OTP is theoretically a perfect secure model for encryption but is not practical to implement.

##### Feistel Cipher

Looked at how the Feistel Cipher works in general. Explained how most modern ciphers use this model, or a similar "round based" model.

##### Data Encryption Standard (DES)

Looked at how DES was one of the first US government encryption standards and how DES uses the Feistel Cipher for it's base functionality.

##### Triple DES (3DES)

Looked at how 3DES is just DES chained three times to add more longevity to the aging standard.

##### Advanced Encryption Standard

Looked at how AES is the modern symmetric standard that is used in most applications. This section could use more detail on the different functions that occur each round.

#### Asymmetric encryption

Graphic of asymmetric encryption

##### Diffie Hellman Key Exchange (DH)

Looked at how DH is the first instance of asymmetric (public keys) and has spawned nearly all other asymmetric algorithms.

Went over a small example of how the process works. If I was more math inclined, this could be expanded more.

##### Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)

Looked at how RSA takes the DH model and relies on the product of two large prime numbers to make cracking computationally difficult.

Went over a small example of how the process works. If I was more math inclined, this could be expanded more.

##### Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC)

Looked at how ECC takes the DH model and relies on discrete logarithms to make cracking computationally difficult.

Went over a small example of how the process works. If I was more math inclined, this could be expanded more.

### Comparison of Symmetric and Asymmetric Algorithms

Looked at the difference in key size for equivalent security between AES, RSA, and ECC.

### Quantum Threats to Cryptography

Looked at Grover's and Shor's algorithm and how they affect modern symmetric and asymmetric algorithms.
