# UUG Information Security (Cryptography) Presentation

Since this presentation is not directly connected to Unix/Linux, I wanted to provide some context if a non-security focused student wants to jump in and try to give this presentation.

The general topics I wanted to cover are:

- The CIA Triad

- Basic cryptography terminology/concepts

- Kerckhoffs's principle

- Types of Ciphers

  - Within this focus of the types of block ciphers

- Types of Encryption

  - Symmetric encryption

    - One-Time Pad (OTP)

    - Feistel Cipher

    - Data Encryption Standard (DES)

    - Triple DES (3DES)

    - Advanced Encryption Standard

  - Asymmetric encryption

    - Diffie Hellman Key Exchange (DH)

    - Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)

    - Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC)

- Comparison of Symmetric and Asymmetric Algorithms

- Quantum Threats to Cryptography
